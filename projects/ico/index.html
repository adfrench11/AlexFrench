              instrument in any jurisdiction. COIN (XCM) Tokens should not be
              acquired for speculative or investment purposes with the
              expectation of making an investment return. No regulatory
              authority has examined or approved any of the information set

              restrictions on the ownership, use, or possession of such tokens.
              Regulators or other competent authorities may demand that CoolCoin
              revises the mechanics and functionality of COIN (XCM) Tokens to
              comply with regulatory requirements or other governmental or
              business obligations. Nevertheless, CoolCoin believe they have

            <p class="has-text-grey-dark">CoolCoin is in the process of undertaking further legal and
              regulatory analysis of the intended functionality and mechanics
              of COIN (XCM) Tokens. Following the conclusion of this analysis,
              we may be required to amend the intended functionality of COIN
              (XCM) Tokens in order to ensure compliance with any legal or
              regulatory obligations that apply to us. We shall update this
              Whitepaper and publish a notice on our website in the event that
              any changes are made to the COIN (XCM) Token functionality.</p>
            <br><p class="has-text-grey-dark">Regulatory licenses and/or approvals in respect of that
              platform and COIN (being the token of this token sale) are likely
              to be required in a number of relevant jurisdictions in which
              CoolCoin intends to operate and in which COIN will be sold. It is
              not possible to guarantee, and CoolCoin does not make any
              assurances, that any such licenses or approvals will be obtained
              within a particular timeframe or at all. This means that the
              platform may not be available in certain markets, or at all.
              This could require fundamental restructuring of the platform
              and/or its unavailability. CoolCoin intends to operate in full
              compliance with applicable laws and regulations and obtain the
              necessary licenses and approvals in key markets. Certain
              functionalities may also be limited to certain persons to meet
              applicable regulatory requirements.</p>

            <p class="has-text-grey-dark">This whitepaper contains forward-looking statements or
              information (collectively “forward-looking statements”) that
              relate to CoolCoin’s current expectations and views of future
              events. In some cases, these forward-looking statements can be
              identified by words or phrases such as “may”, “will”, “expect”,
              “anticipate”, “aim”, “estimate”, “intend”, “plan”, “seek”,
              “believe”, “potential”, “continue”, “is/are likely to” or the
              negative of these terms, or other similar expressions intended
              to identify forward-looking statements.</p>
            <br><p class="has-text-grey-dark">CoolCoin has based these forward-looking statements on its
              current expectations and projections about future events and
              financial trends that it believes may affect its financial
              condition, results of operations, business strategy, financial
              needs, or the results of the token sale or the value or price
              stability of COIN (XCM) Tokens.</p>
            <br><p class="has-text-grey-dark">In addition to statements relating to the matters set out
              here, this whitepaper contains forward-looking statements
              related to CoolCoin’s proposed operating model. The model speaks to
              its objectives only, and is not a forecast, projection or
              prediction of future results of operations. Forward-looking
              statements are based on certain assumptions and analysis made by
              CoolCoin in light of its experience and perception of historical
              trends, current conditions and expected future developments and
              other factors it believes are appropriate, and are subject to
              risks and uncertainties. Although the forward-looking statements
              contained in this whitepaper are based upon what CoolCoin believes
              are reasonable assumptions, these risks, uncertainties,
              assumptions, and other factors could cause CoolCoin’s actual
              results, performance, achievements, and experience to differ
              materially from its expectations which are expressed, implied,
              or perceived in forward-looking statements. Given such risks,
              prospective participants in this token sale should not place
              undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.</p>

            strategic partner, FXPIG, an established Forex
            (“FX”) broker. FXPIG’s proven track record and
            experience in providing financial services will
            help CoolCoin to deliver its planned “Token
            Buyback Program.” The Token Buyback
            Program is one of the ways CoolCoin will look
            to initially stabilize the price of COIN and
            support market growth (See Section 4.0.4 for
            more information). Sharing of technology and
            human resources between CoolCoin and
            FXPIG will allow the CoolCoin Exchange to
            offer features, opportunities, and token sale

            <p class="has-text-grey-dark">Hileman &amp; Rauchs emphasize that the biggest challenges faced by current
            cryptocurrency exchanges are maintaining relationships with payment
            gateways, banks, and traditional financial institutions. Based on an analysis
            of non-public data from over 150 companies in the cryptocurrency space,
            their study notes, “Small exchanges seem to have considerable difficulties
            with either obtaining or maintaining banking relationships…”5 Immediately
            upon launch of the CoolCoin Exchange, CoolCoin intends to operate as a
            registered eMoney Institution.</p>
            <br><p class="has-text-grey-dark">Running a multi-faceted fintech platform means that we will require
            multiple licenses in multiple jurisdictions to remain compliant with regards
            to the services we plan to provide. The CoolCoin Token Sale will be based in
            Hong Kong, and compliant with the regulatory environment there. Moving
            forward, CoolCoin intends to provide services in jurisdictions
            where it is licensed, or where no license is required. During 2018, CoolCoin
            intends to apply for licenses in several jurisdictions that cover the full range
            of planned services.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="column is-5">
            <p class="has-text-grey-dark">As of November 25th, 2017, CoolCoin is in the process of obtaining an
            eMoney license in Georgia and an Alternative Payment (And Crypto
            Exchange) License in Estonia. Our intention for the eMoney license is that it
            will enable operation of the payment services side of our business, dealing in
            fiat transactions with countries outside the European Union, where
            applicable by law. The Estonia license will allow us to operate our exchange,
            dealing in both fiatand crypto, serving clients both within the EU and
            worldwide, subject to applicable law, and accept payments via multiple
            gateways, including SEPA transfers, SWIFT transfers, credit cards, and
            external wallet systems, from residents of the European Union.</p>
            <br><p class="has-text-grey-dark">We are also currently in talks to begin the process of acquiring an SIB Fund
            Management license in the Cayman Islands. This license would cover our
            ETCF and possibly our TAM platforms, and allow us to offer these services to a
            wide range of countries around the world, subject to the laws of each applicable jurisdiction.
            We will look to acquire additional licenses in order to expand our regulatory
            footprint and remain compliant as CoolCoin grows, and as new regulations
            come to light around the world.</p>

            <br><p class="title is-2 is-spaced">CoolCoin Ecosystem</p>
            <p class="has-text-grey-light">Summary</p>
            <br>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="columns is-centered">
          <div class="column is-3">
            <p class="has-text-grey-light">Featuring a simple interface designed for mainstream adoption, the CoolCoin platform plans to serve as a conduit between traditional finance and the digital asset economy. CoolCoin’s multifaceted ecosystem will streamline three major components of the digital economy, offering: (i) an exchange, (ii) a trading platform, and (iii) a complete ICO Express framework.</p>
            <br><p class="has-text-weight-bold">Competitive Advantage</p>
            <br><p class="has-text-grey-light">Working in tandem with FXPIG, CoolCoin plans to offer a wide range of services previously unavailable from a single entity. For new users entering the cryptocurrency space, two essential features are simplicity and the ability to purchase digital assets with fiat. Coinbase/GDAX is a clear testament to this, reportedly adding over 100,000 new users per day during peak times in late 2017.1 Ranking in volume as the world’s second largest Bitcoin exchange2, Coinbase/GDAX is obviously an ambitious project to compete with. However, while Coinbase offers an intuitive user interface and easy fiat/crypto exchange, it supports a limited number of digital currencies and trading pairs, and its customer support has been widely criticized by users3. CoolCoin integrates fiat support and a user-friendly interface, but offers a much broader range of on-platform functionality (like GDAX and Coinbase in one place, and then some). Plus, we are making customer support a major priority. We believe we are well positioned to provide a competitive alternative to Coinbase and similar platforms in overlapping jurisdictions.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="column is-3">
            <p class="has-text-grey-light">In addition to appealing to new and casual users, our trading platform will be equipped with a robust tool-set designed to meet the needs of professional investors. CoolCoin will offer customizable charting and analytics, support for a range of order types, lending options, and margin trading, here more akin to platforms like Bitfinex and Poloniex, but with a much cleaner UI, no reliance on Tether, more reliable uptime, progressive regulatory footprint, and transparent company policies.</p>
            <br><p class="has-text-grey-light">Our in-house XCM token is conceptually similar to Binance’s BNB and KuCoin’s KCS, two projects which have seen significant growth and rapid adoption since going live. We believe this bodes well for the role of XCM, which offers similar benefits to users (reduced fees, etc.) and has further actionable use cases for features that are currently unavailable through those exchanges.</p>
            <br><p class="has-text-grey-light">We feel as though the combination of an easy-to-use UI, crypto/fiat support, and advanced trading features already makes CoolCoin very competitive in the exchange space. Beyond that, the introduction of our unique investment models (ETCF’s and TAM Accounts) and our turnkey ICO Express engine pushes CoolCoin beyond being “just an exchange” and solidifies our vision of being a one-stop, all-in-one platform for crypto.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="column is-3">
            <p class="has-text-weight-bold">Market Share</p>
            <br><p class="has-text-grey-light">Based on a study of over 400 ICO’s conducted in 2017, ICO Watchlist found that over 50% were implemented using the Ethereum blockchain.1 As more projects begin to explore tokenization of assets and services, CoolCoin is positioned to emerge as a forerunner in this space. We plan to offer an interface for easy token issuance through our ICO Express platform, as well as bring liquidity to the ERC-20 space through our exchange and ETCF Platform.</p>
            <br><p class="has-text-grey-light">Looking at the future of digital assets, tokenization appears poised to open the doors to new markets for mainstream blockchain adoption. While we will naturally offer bitcoin and traditional crypto services, CoolCoin’s vision also includes building the infrastructure to support emerging tokenized asset markets, which we believe will represent a substantial market. As University of Oregon Finance professor Stephen McKeon wrote, “Financial economists have attempted to measure the illiquidity discount in a variety of ways. A common rule of thumb is 20–30%. This represents a huge amount of value and therein lies great promise. Tokenizing relatively illiquid assets and creating a market in which to trade these tokens can reduce the illiquidity discount substantially by reducing frictions to trade. Traditional assets will tokenize because they will lose the liquidity premium if they don’t.”</p>

            <p id="direct-payment-process" class="has-text-weight-bold has-text-grey-dark">Direct Payment Process – Cryptocurrency and Fiat Support</p>
            <br><p class="has-text-grey">Direct payment processing in fiat and cryptocurrencies will be possible through CoolCoin’s stable banking relationships fostered by its registered and licensed eMoney status in Georgia and Estonia which it is currently pursuing. This feature will be available to both direct CoolCoin clients and to third-party clients, such as companies running their own ICO through our easy-to-use blockchain infrastructure.</p>
            <br><p id="debit-card" class="has-text-weight-bold has-text-grey-dark">CoolCoin Debit Card</p>
            <br><p class="has-text-grey">To provide clients with instant access to their CoolCoin wallet balances, we plan to offer a
            CoolCoin debit card. We envision that clients will be able use the CoolCoin debit card to
            access their cryptocurrency wallets or fiat wallet and withdraw cash instantly at certain ATM
            locations worldwide. Having already implemented a successful debit card system for FXPIG, our team has a comprehensive understanding of the logistics of this space and we have developed a solution designed to provide maximum flexibility and utility to CoolCoin users. Clients may choose a default account for use with the card as well as a list of secondary accounts that can be debited in case the balance of the default account is insufficient to cover the requested transaction. When using the card at an ATM, the system will check the balance in the default account first. If a conversion is needed to the withdraw currency, an order will hit our matching engine to perform the conversion instantly, eliminating inconvenient delays in processing time. If the default account has insufficient funds, the secondary accounts will be debited.</p>
            <br><p id="risk-limitation" class="has-text-weight-bold has-text-grey-dark">Risk Limitation</p>
            <br><p class="has-text-grey">We propose that CoolCoin’s underlying risk management strategy will use designated
            margin wallets to mitigate damages and prevent losses when trading using borrowed
            margin on our give and take lending platform. Position losses will be covered by funds in a
            trader’s margin wallet, which serve solely as collateral. If the net value of a trader’s account
            falls below the required maintenance margin, their position will be forced into liquidation.
            To open a position, we propose that a trader will be initially required to allocate 30% margin
            based on the desired position size. Should the net value of the account fall below 15% of
            the value of the margin position, the account will be liquidated.</p>
            <br><p id="decentralization" class="has-text-weight-bold has-text-grey-dark">Decentralization and Atomic Swaps</p>
            <br><p class="has-text-grey">Generally, cryptocurrency exchanges are at least “semi-centralized,” given that assets are often
            held by the exchange on behalf of its client base. The move toward fully decentralized exchange mechanisms has begun, and CoolCoin plans to take a proactive approach to this technology. The CoolCoin team sees technology like <a href="#">Polkadot</a>, <a href="#">Cosmos</a>, and <a href="#">Aion</a> approaching, and understands that atomic swaps and cross chain communication will be extremely significant going forward.
            CoolCoin intends to offer atomic swap-like ‘peer-2-peer secure exchanges’ using time locked smart contracts where no third party intervention is needed to complete the transaction. The smart contract will act as a form of timed escrow, ensuring that both parties are protected in the event that one party defaults on the transaction. It is intended that this exchange mechanism will carry fees that will be almost zero from our side, as it will be considered an added service for clients who are trading smaller volumes and those that do not require immediate execution.</p>

            <p id="trading-gui" class="has-text-weight-bold has-text-grey-dark">Trading GUI</p>
            <br><p class="has-text-grey">The Matching Engine will allow clients to send both standard and non-standard order types,
            including: Markets, Limits, Stops, Limit Stop Orders and OCO (One Cancels Other) orders,
            which are a combination of Stop and Limit orders on the same ticket. The system will also allow for several different TIF (Time in Force) options, such as FOK (Fill or Kill), IOC (Immediate or Cancel), and GTC (Good till Cancelled).</p>
            <br><p class="has-text-grey">Charting will be powered by a professional grade HTML5 library that allows users to customize their layout with a few clients and add in multiple time and price studies or indicators with ease. Using a simple drag-and-drop interface, clients will be able place stop and limit orders based on
            pre-calculated risk to reward settings. To reduce latency for higher frequency traders and to
            simplify the order enter process one click trading will be available right from the chart. Historical trades, both filled and pending orders, can be plotted on the chart, as well, so the client will be able to see a graphical representation of their account activity.</p>
            <br><p class="has-text-grey">The platform is intended to be accessible from both a web browser and via our own
            CoolCoin-branded iOS and Android apps. API access and FIX 4.4 connectivity will be
            available. Following the approach of our strategic partner, FXPIG, API and FIX access will be open to anyone who requests it, with no minimum volume requirements or access fees.</p>
            <br><p id="lending" class="has-text-weight-bold has-text-grey-dark">Lending</p>
            <br><p class="has-text-grey">CoolCoin’s unique lending platform is intended to give passive investors an opportunity to earn interest on their cryptocurrency balances and create potential for under-capitalized traders to increase their profits. Our lending platform is envisaged to work by letting lenders state their daily rate on which they are prepared to lend; borrowers will be able to accept and immediately use the underlying assets as margin. CoolCoin plans to offer BTC, LTC, and ETH lending options.</p>
            <br><p id="exchange-fee-structure" class="has-text-weight-bold has-text-grey-dark">Exchange Fee Structure (Bonus)</p>
            <br><p class="has-text-grey">Our proposal intends that takers on the exchange, or clients who place orders that are filled immediately, will pay a commission on all executed orders, starting from a MAXIMUM of 0.10%. Makers onto the exchange, clients who place limit orders below the ticker price on the buy side, and above the ticker price on the sell side, will receive rebates that account for up to 50% of any fee charged to the taker that eventually hits their resting orders. If two makers’ orders are eventually matched (i.e. neither side is matched immediately) neither will be paid a rebate, but no commissions will be charged to either side.</p>
            <br><p id="cryptocurrency-wallet" class="has-text-weight-bold has-text-grey-dark">Cryptocurrency Wallet – Supported Cryptocurrencies</p>
            <br><p class="has-text-grey">CoolCoin’s cryptocurrency wallet system will allow clients to hold, deposit and withdraw in the five largest digital currencies by market capitalization (~80%):</p>

              <li>- Litecoin (LTC)</li>
            </ul>
            <br><p class="has-text-grey">By partnering with BitGo, the industry leader in multi-signature, multi-currency wallets,
            CoolCoin plans to offer clients convenient and secure services through BitGo’s multi-signature
            technology.</p>
            <br><p class="has-text-grey">Following our initial launch, CoolCoin plans to incorporate support for additional wallet
            platforms, adding more and more assets over time. Immediately after launch we will look to add support for the complete list of top ten cryptocurrencies mentioned on Coin Market Cap (https://coinmarketcap.com), including Monero (XMR), Dash (DASH), NEO (NEO), and BitCoin Gold (BTG). We will also look to add NEM (XEM) given that we will be developing tools based on the NEM blockchain. We plan to add additional assets over time, including ERC20 tokens, which will form the base for our EFTC platform (Section 3.3.2).</p>
            <br><p id="leverage" class="has-text-weight-bold has-text-grey-dark">Leverage</p>
            <br><p class="has-text-grey">Liquidity provider relationships, fostered by our strategic partner, FXPIG, allows us to offer
            clients access to 1:50 leverage when trading non-deliverable OTC digital assets, either via our
            browser based platform or through an API or FIX connectivity. Leverage on our matching engine will be capped at 1:10 initially when trading using borrowed margin by way of our give and take lending platform. Higher leverage will be made available to clients with a proven track record of low risk operations on a case by case basis. Via our partnership with FXPIG, CoolCoin intends to offer FIX and API access to our exchange by way of a Prime of Prime model where FXPIG is the margin/credit provider. This will give individual and institutional traders access to exchange grade liquidity, spreads, and execution quality, paired with CFD like available leverage.</p>
            <br><p id="ecosystem-growth" class="has-text-weight-bold has-text-grey-dark">Ecosystem growth</p>
            <br><p class="has-text-grey">We believe that giving people additional opportunities to earn by engaging with the platform will incentivize client participation, retention, and enthusiasm. It also ensures more liquidity within the engine, which keeps spreads low and generates higher overall volumes. We intend for users to be rewarded for participation in COIN, and for the scope of rewarded activities to grow and change as the platform develops. At release of the CoolCoin platform users will be rewarded for simply signing up to CoolCoin and creating a wallet, using the exchange for the first time, referring friends to the platform, and completing user feedback forms designed to help the team improve the platform.</p>

            <p>Tokenized Asset Management (TAM) is a unique concept developed by the CoolCoin team. TAM will allow professional asset managers to sell tokens in their trading performance to investors. Each pro trader (or “manager”) will be issued a unique personal token valued in and available for purchase priced in COIN, a fully minted ERC20 token that is used to price all CoolCoin products and services. COIN is our own uniq ue digital asset created to facilitate interaction with our infrastructure and provide transparency to our client base by way of the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="column is-5">
            <p>Through TAM, clients will be able to work with a manager of their choice by investing in that manager’s token. Similar to earning a commission, managers will profit from fees based on the high-water mark principle (i.e. the highest peak in value for a given account), and investors will 6 benefit based on the growth of their investment. With a few clicks, investors will be able to quickly move funds between manager-specific tokens, COIN, and other crypto or fiat assets. Blockchain-based tokenization will facilitate a secure and transparent process, where each trade can be linked back to specific investors and managers, giving users a complete overview of their digital assets at all times.</p>

With one click, users will be able to invest in multiple tokens, diversifying into a specific industry, such as healthcare, IoT, communication, or finance. Users will also be able to invest in a fund based on its risk profile, or even the social media influencer scores of tokens grouped inside the fund.</p>

            <br><p class="has-text-grey">As with our TAM platform, all ETCF’s will be priced in COIN. We believe that pricing these products in COIN will contribute to token price stability, and as usage of the platform accelerates we expect to see this positively affect the underlying price.</p>

We propose that main authorization will be performed using tokens in request headers with all the resource collections being processed in standalone units whenever possible. The API’s internal functionalities are envisaged to be quite complex; however, the external layer is planned to be been kept open and remain simple to work with. Access permissions will be restricted and closely monitored, with end users only able to gain access to specific portions of the full API workflow. Frequent onsite security audits are intended to ensure that the API is constantly evolving based on real world production level risk analysis.</p>

          <div class="column is-8 has-text-centered">
            <br><br><p class="title is-2 is-spaced">Long Term</p>
            <p class="has-text-grey-lighter">Stability of COIN</p>
            <br><br><br>
            <p>Many ERC20 tokens focus on speculation rather than utility, which is not encouraged by CoolCoin. Long term value, for those tokens, starts at utility and also relies on supply and demand. In order to manage supply, help reduce volatility and enable persons who need COIN to obtain them, CoolCoin has created a three-pronged approach as outlined here:</p>
            <br><br>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="columns is-centered">
          <div class="column is-5">
            <p>The creation of a Token Buyback Reserve, funded with up to 20% of CoolCoin’s and FXPIG’s net profits. CoolCoin intends to use the Token Buyback Reserve to support the stability of COIN on the CoolCoin exchange as needed. To facilitate liquidity on both buy and sell sides, COIN bought back by CoolCoin will be sold onto the exchange as needed depending on the underlying demand. NOTE: Net Profits here refers to net operating profits once CoolCoin is fully operational and does not in any way relate to the sums collected by way of the scheduled Pre-Token or Token Sales. Purchasers have no rights in respect of the Token Buyback Reserve and the use of the profits is at CoolCoin’s discretion and control. It is also subject to applicable legal and regulatory requirements.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="has-text-grey-lighter">Gauging the possible size of this reserve is difficult at the outset of the initial Token Sale. On the FXPIG side, the numbers are easier to discern given its verifiable track record. On the CoolCoin side, projections are generally based on market size and capitalization, as well as speculation based on published data from competitors and general market research. In this light we anticipate year one focusing on establishing the brand and fostering its initial growth. Year two, we see gross margin somewhere in the area of 8 to 10 million EUR. Year three pushes this sum higher, to upwards of 18-22 million EUR. These figures would mean a total market penetration equalling approximately 1.25% for year two and 2.5% for year three, based on the current total volumes traded, which will increase over time.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="has-text-grey-lighter">It is planned that all fees payable to CoolCoin, either on our exchange, via our investment vehicles, such as the TAM and ETCF platforms, or for our ICO-related services via the ICO Express gateway, will be paid in COIN.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="column is-5">
            <p class="has-text-grey-lighter">We expect that demand for COIN will rise with usage of CoolCoin’s service. Rising demand implies higher prices over time. Each time a fee is paid, whether it is priced in BTC, ETH, USD, or any other currency, an equivalent amount of COIN will be purchased on the exchange to cover said fees. Thus, the buy side on our exchange platform will be very active. In the event that no sell orders are present to support the needed conversions, resting COIN sell orders from CoolCoin’s liquidity reserve will be added to the book at a price equal to the indicative market value.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In order to create a strong long term value proposition for COIN, we intend that 1%, 5%, 10% or 33% of each fee payment will be burned. As usage of the platform accelerates, the availability of the COIN token will diminish, thus decreasing supply and helping to maintain a competitive economic model for COIN.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We intend that holders of COIN tokens will be offered discounts on fees based on their overall COIN holdings. The more COIN they own, the higher the discount will be. This will likely incentivize clients to buy and hold COIN, further reducing the available supply. NOTE – This is part and partial to the LIFETIME discounts offered to our pre-Token Sale and Token Sale contributors which are not based on their total individual contribution.</p>

The reality is that most larger token sale events offer substantial discounts to private investors prior to their public pre-sale events, so while this may appear excessive it is in fact commonplace with the difference here being that CoolCoin has decided to offer these ‘friends and family’ discounts to the community at large rather than to a small select group of private investors.</p>
